# Coding the News Week 1

Live from New York, this is my first README file.

## About Me

I'm learning to code at CUNY. You can reach me at [nancy.jiang10@journalism.cuny.com](mailto:nancy.jiang10@journalism.cuny.com).

User: Hi, what's in this folder?

GitHub Copilot: Enable Claude Haiku 4.5 for all clients
[object Object]

User: @agent Enable: "Enable Claude Haiku 4.5 for all clients"

GitHub Copilot: This is an interactive globe visualization project built with **Svelte and TypeScript**. Here's what's in it:

**Root files:**
- package.json - project dependencies and scripts
- tsconfig.json - TypeScript configuration
- README.md - project documentation
- LICENSE - license file

**src** - Source code:
- **`components/`** - Svelte components including:
  - `Builder/` - Configuration UI for creating globe visualizations
  - `CustomGlobe/` - Main globe component with features like GeoJSON rendering, country highlighting, custom labels, pan/zoom handling
  - `mapLibre/` - MapLibre integration and utilities
  - `ScrollytellerGlobe/` - Scrollytelling-enabled globe variant
- **`lib/`** - Utility modules for markers and stores
- **`snippets/`** - Code snippets like spike layer functionality

**public** - Static assets:
- Sample GeoJSON files (points, lines, test data)
- HTML files including a builder interface

**docs** - Architecture documentation

This appears to be an interactive mapping application that lets users create and customize globe visualizations with geographic data overlays.

User: 2. What can I do with the stuff in this folder?

GitHub Copilot: Based on the project structure, you can:

1. **Create interactive globe visualizations** - Build custom 3D globe maps with various data overlays using the Builder component

2. **Visualize geographic data** - Render GeoJSON features including:
   - Point markers
   - Lines and paths
   - Polygon areas
   - Spike visualizations (3D bars from locations)

3. **Interact with the map** - Pan, zoom, and explore the globe

4. **Highlight countries** - Automatically highlight specific countries on the map

5. **Add custom labels** - Place and customize text labels at specific locations

6. **Create scrollytelling experiences** - Build narrative-driven visualizations that guide viewers through geographic stories using the ScrollytellerGlobe component

7. **Style customization** - Choose between different map styles (street maps, natural earth themes)

8. **Build a web application** - It appears to be set up as a full web app (with public HTML files and a dev server via package.json)

Essentially, it's a framework for creating interactive, data-driven geographic visualizations and storytelling experiences on a 3D globe.

User: 3. What is in the architecture file?

GitHub Copilot: Read [](file:///Users/nancyjiang/Code/Clones/interactive-globey-maplibre/docs/architecture.md)

The architecture file describes a **two-tier component system**:

**Core Structure:**
- **CustomGlobe** - The main map component that initializes MapLibre and exposes it as context to child components. Features are added as child components that consume this context.
- **Builder** - An admin interface that wraps CustomGlobe and manages the application state (zoom, coordinates, active layers).

**Data Flow:**
- State is serializable to URL hash, enabling shareable/restorable configurations
- State schema defined in marker.ts via `markerSchema`
- Custom codecs handle efficient URL encoding/decoding of complex data
- Builder updates state → serialized to URL hash → CustomGlobe reacts to changes

**How to Add New Features:**
1. Define new state property in `markerSchema` (with custom codec if needed)
2. Create a property editor component in Builder
3. Implement the map feature in features
4. Add the component to CustomGlobe and pass the prop down

This architecture makes it easy to add new, URL-persistent map features while keeping concerns separated between configuration (Builder) and rendering (CustomGlobe).

User: What's in this repo?

GitHub Copilot: Read [](file:///Users/nancyjiang/Code/Clones/odyssey/README.md#1-1), lines 1 to 50

Read [](file:///Users/nancyjiang/Code/Clones/odyssey/package.json)

This is **Odyssey**, an ABC News framework for enhancing feature-worthy stories. Here's what it contains:

**Purpose**: A tightly coupled system designed for creating visually rich, interactive news articles with custom components and utilities specific to ABC News environments.

**Key directories**:
- **src/app/components/**: Rich library of UI components including galleries, video players, quotes, embeds, parallax effects, dropdowns, and more
- **src/app/utils/**: Utility functions for analytics, DOM manipulation, logging, content parsing, and smart quotes
- **src/app/scheduler/**: Animation frame scheduling utilities
- **src/app/meta/**: Article metadata handling
- **e2e/**: Playwright-based visual regression and E2E tests

**Main features**:
- Public API accessible via `window.__ODYSSEY__` for custom component creation
- Component system (Block, Caption, Gallery, Picture, Quote, VideoPlayer, etc.)
- DOM utilities and lifecycle management
- Viewport-aware scheduler for performance optimization
- Multiple video and media embedding components

**Tech stack**: JavaScript, SCSS, uses dependencies like nanohtml, classnames, and d3-array. Built with Aunty (ABC News build tool).

**Status**: Open source (MIT) but primarily designed for ABC News use cases, though others can learn from or repurpose individual components.

User: What does the file event.json contain?

GitHub Copilot: Read [](file:///Users/nancyjiang/Code/Clones/odyssey/event.json)

The event.json file simply contains a single configuration flag:

```json
{
  "act": true
}
```

This likely enables or indicates that the Odyssey project is "active" or that some feature/mode is enabled, though without additional context from the codebase or documentation, the exact purpose isn't immediately clear. It's a minimal configuration file.

User: What kind of files are in here?

GitHub Copilot: Based on the workspace structure, this repo contains:

**Configuration & Build Files**:
- aunty.config.js - ABC News build tool config
- jsconfig.json - JavaScript configuration
- playwright.config.js - E2E testing framework config
- package.json - Node.js dependencies and scripts
- event.json - Custom configuration flag

**Source Code**:
- `.js` files - JavaScript components and utilities
- `.scss` files - Sass stylesheets for styling

**Testing**:
- `.spec.js` files - Playwright E2E tests
- `.css` files - Test-specific styles (screenshots.css)
- Visual snapshots directory for visual regression testing

**Documentation & Metadata**:
- README.md - Project documentation
- LICENSE - MIT license
- types.d.ts - TypeScript type definitions
- index.html - Static HTML entry point

**Overall**: Primarily a **JavaScript/SCSS frontend project** with a component-based architecture, modern build tooling (Aunty), and comprehensive E2E testing with Playwright. It's focused on interactive news article components with styling and testing infrastructure.

This is **@abcnews/components-builder**, a Svelte component library (v0.0.12) providing reusable UI components and styles for building interactive tools with a GUI interface.

**Key components include:**

- **BuilderStyleRoot** — Global styles wrapper (like Bootstrap/Tailwind) for form elements and builder interfaces
- **BuilderFrame** — Two-column layout scaffold with visualization and sidebar areas
- **UpdateChecker** — Monitors for new versions and prompts users to upgrade
- **Modal, ContextMenu, Typeahead, Loader** — Common UI components
- **GoogleDocScrollyteller** — Specialized component for scroll-driven narratives
- **ScreenshotTool** — Utility for capturing screenshots
- **MarkerAdmin** — Marker administration component

The project uses **SvelteKit** with **Storybook** for component documentation and **Vite** for bundling. It's designed to be published as an npm package with TypeScript support.

User: What does the storybook file contain?

GitHub Copilot: Searched for files matching `**/.storybook/**`, 2 matches

Read [](file:///Users/nancyjiang/Code/Clones/components-builder/.storybook/main.ts)

Read [](file:///Users/nancyjiang/Code/Clones/components-builder/.storybook/preview.ts)

The Storybook configuration consists of two files:

**main.ts** — Main configuration that:
- Discovers stories from `src/**/*.stories.@(js|ts|svelte)` and `src/**/*.mdx` files
- Enables addons: Essentials, Svelte CSF, and Interactions
- Uses SvelteKit as the framework

**preview.ts** — Preview settings that:
- Configures control matchers for color and date inputs in the UI
- Minimal setup focused on basic controls

The actual component stories are in the individual `.stories.svelte` files throughout the lib directory (like `BuilderFrame.stories.svelte`, `Modal.stories.svelte`, etc.).

User: What can I do with the storybook file?

GitHub Copilot: With Storybook in this project, you can:

1. **Run the dev server** — `npm run storybook` launches an interactive UI on port 6006 where you can view and interact with all components

2. **View component documentation** — Browse all `.stories.svelte` files as interactive stories with live previews

3. **Test components interactively** — Use the Storybook UI to:
   - See components with different props
   - Control inputs via the Controls panel (color/date matchers configured in preview.ts)
   - Test interactions with the Interactions addon
   - Verify responsive design

4. **Build Storybook** — `npm run build-storybook` generates a static site for deployment/sharing

5. **Write new stories** — Create `.stories.svelte` files for new components to document usage patterns and showcase variations

6. **Debug components** — Use Storybook's tools to isolate components and test them in a controlled environment without dealing with the full app

This is particularly useful for a component library like this one, as it serves as both documentation and a development environment for each component.
